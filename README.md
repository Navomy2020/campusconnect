📌 Project Description
The platform converts informal doubt-clearing discussions into a centralized, searchable academic knowledge base.
❗ The Problem Statement
In most colleges:
Doubts are discussed in WhatsApp groups or informal chats.
Important explanations get lost.
There is no structured storage of academic discussions.
Contributors do not receive recognition.
There is no measurable academic contribution tracking.
There is a need for a structured internal knowledge-sharing system.
💡 The Solution
CampusConnect provides:
A structured dashboard for students
Domain-based classification of questions
A separate "Solve Question" module
Dynamic question navigation
A leaderboard ranking system
Recognition-driven academic engagement
The platform ensures:
Permanent knowledge storage
Domain-based filtering
Easy question solving interface
Contribution-based ranking
